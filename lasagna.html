    <h3>The Best Vegan Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t say this lightly… This is the BEST and EASIEST vegan lasagna
      recipe! Layered with a rich marinara, creamy ricotta, spinach, noodles and
      topped with ooey-gooey vegan mozzarella cheese. No need to pre-cook the
      noodles
    </p>
    <div class="Ingredients">
      <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried red lentils</li>
        <li>(2) 25-ounce jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
        <li>14.5 ounce firm tofu patted dry</li>
        <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice from about 2 lemons</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 cups baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 box lasagna noodles (about 12 noodles</li>
        <li>2-3 cups shredded vegan mozzarella</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook the red lentils. Add 1 cup dried red lentils and 3 cups of water
          to a medium pot. Bring to a boil, and then simmer for about 20
          minutes. Drain the lentils in a fine strainer, and then add back to
          the pot and stir in the marinara sauce. Set aside
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degree</li>
        <li>
          Make the Cashew-Tofu Ricotta: Add the cashews to a food processor and
          process until fine and crumbly. Then add the tofu in chunks,
          nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, basil, oregano and garlic powder
          to the food processor. Pulse until well combined and pretty smooth. If
          it's too thick, add a few tablespoons of water to blend. Set aside
        </li>
        <li>
          Assembling the lasagna: Add about 1 cup of lentil marinara to the
          bottom of a large 9×13 inch casserole dish. Spread it around evenly.
          Next add 4-5 lasagna noodles (uncooked). Spread half of the ricotta on
          top of the noodles. Top with half of the spinach. Add about 1 cup of
          the marinara sauce over the spinach, then place 4-5 lasagna noodles on
          top. Spread the rest of the ricotta over the noodles, then the rest of
          the spinach. Place 4-5 more noodles on top of the spinach, and then
          pour the rest of the sauce over the top, evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Cover tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          While the lasagna is cooking, make your Vegan Mozzarella Cheese, if
          using. Alternatively, use 2-3 cups store bought vegan mozzarella
          cheese
        </li>
        <li>
          After 40 minutes, remove the foil and spoon on the mozzarella (or
          sprinkle the cheese all over). Place the lasagna back in the oven and
          bake for 20 more minutes, uncovered. Remove from oven, let cool for at
          least 15 minutes and serve
        </li>
        <li>
          Leftover lasagna will keep for about 4 days in the refrigerator. See
          notes for freezing instructions.
