    </ul>

      <li>32 ounces (4 8-ounce packages) Tofutti vegan cream cheese</li>
      <li>(1) 13.5 ounce can coconut cream</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, from about 2 small lemons</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Optional fresh strawberry sauce</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest, from 1 small lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Wrap a 9 inch springform pan with 1-2
        layers of aluminum foil, covering the bottom and the sides. Cut a circle
        of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan, and spray lightly with
        oil.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>For the crust</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, add the cookie crumbs, melted vegan butter and sugar.
        Stir well to combine, then press down into the bottom of the prepared
        pan. Press down firmly and evenly, going up the sides a little. Set
        aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>For the filling</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer with the whisk attachment, or using a
        handheld mixer, beat the vegan cream cheese until smooth, about 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the rest of the filling ingredients and beat until smooth,
        scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once it’s completely smooth, pour into prepared pan over the crust and
        spread evenly.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>To bake</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place in the oven and bake for 50 minutes. Do not open the oven door
        during this time. Turn off the heat, and let it sit in the oven for 10
        more minutes. The cheesecake will be slightly jiggly, and not look very
        done in the middle. That is correct, it will firm up when it cools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, and let it cool for about 15 minutes at room
        temperature before moving to the refrigerator to cool for at least 4
        hours, preferably overnight, before slicing and serving. When ready to
        serve, slice and serve with any optional toppings.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Optional fresh strawberry sauce</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a food processor, add 1 1/4 cups of the sliced strawberries
        (reserving 1/4 cup), sugar and lemon zest. Process until smooth. Toss
        with the sliced strawberries in a small bowl and chill for at least an
        hour before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Storing: Leftover cheesecake will keep for up to 7 days in the
        refrigerator. It can also be frozen.
